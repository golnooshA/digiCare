# DigiCare

People typically face a loss in their health as they age, including getting weaker, more prone to illness, having less vision, etc. They, therefore, require special medical treatment. Accordingly, DigiCare works to create a tool that could assist patients, the elderly, and their companions in managing and monitoring their health.

This application has a section for medical history data, allowing users to keep track of their health information. Users can also schedule doctor appointments using the app, and pill reminders are included to help users remember to take their medications on schedule.
